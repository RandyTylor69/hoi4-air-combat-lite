You can find the code in "src". 
A portion of the code, named "main", exists as a testground. Upon removal it will not impact the utility of the program. 

This simulator features 2 phases: detection and combat. The detection phase uses figures that are randomized to simualte the weather penalties.
Other things like air mission efficiency or range is not taken into account - you should always have enough range before you enter combat.
